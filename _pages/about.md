I am driven by solving biological and medical problems with computational tools.

I always wanted to become a biologist and I learned programming as a hobby. When bioinformatics became a thing, I was lucky to combine my two interests and became a bioinformatician.

I have 7+ years of experience in the development of pipelines for genomic and transcriptomic data analyses. I program in *Python*, *R*, and *Bash*. To make my projects reproducible and scalable, I use *Git* for version control, *Snakemake* for pipelines, *Conda/Docker* for virtual environments, *R Markdown* for explanation and communication.

I am very interested in Big Data analyses. Genomic data is Big Data in a sense but current approaches to processing genomic data are still lagging behind the industry standards of Big Data processing. I believe that analyzing genomic data in Apache Spark is the future and such projects as [ADAM](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam){:target="_blank"}, [Hail](https://hail.is/){:target="_blank"}, [VariantSpark](https://github.com/aehrc/VariantSpark){:target="_blank"} will advance genomic analyses.

Currently, I am seeking to leverage my passion and expertise to help develop automated large-scale bioinformatic analyses in an industrial or academic setting.
