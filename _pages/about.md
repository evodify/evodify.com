I am driven by solving biological and medical problems with computational tools.

I always wanted to become a biologist and I also learned programming as a hobby. When bioinformatics became a thing, I was lucky to combine my two interests and turn into a bioinformatician.

I have 7+ years of experience in the development of pipelines for large scale genomic and transcriptomic data analyses. I program in [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"}, [R](https://www.r-project.org/){:target="_blank"}, and [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/){:target="_blank"}. To make my projects reproducible and scalable, I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/){:target="_blank"} for version control, [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io){:target="_blank"} for pipelines, [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/){:target="_blank"}/[Docker](https://www.docker.com/){:target="_blank"} for virtual environments, [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} for explanation and communication.

I am very interested in Big Data analyses. Genomic data is Big Data in a sense but current approaches to processing genomic data are still lagging behind the industry standards of Big Data processing. I believe that analyzing genomic data in Apache Spark is the future and such projects as [ADAM](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam){:target="_blank"}, [Hail](https://hail.is/){:target="_blank"}, [VariantSpark](https://github.com/aehrc/VariantSpark){:target="_blank"} will advance genomic analyses.

Currently, I am seeking to leverage my passion and expertise to help develop automated large scale bioinformatic analyses in an industrial or academic setting.
