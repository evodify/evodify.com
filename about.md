## Me and my research interests

<img align="right" alt="Portrait of Dmytro Kryvokhyzha" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pages/about_Dmytro-Kryvokhyzha.jpeg">

My name is Dmytro Kryvokhyzha. Yesâ€¦ I knowâ€¦ my last name is complicated. Almost no one can pronounce it correctly ðŸ™‚ .

I did my PhD on genome evolution and adaptation in the allotetraploid weed *Capsella bursa-pastoris* in <a href="https://lascouxlab.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Martin Lascoux group</a>. Currently, I work as a postdoc in <a href="https://www.imbim.uu.se/forskargrupper/genetik-och-genomik/axelsson-erik/" target="_blank">Erik Axelsson group</a> and I look for genomic changes associated with diet adaptation in dogs. During my research career, I also studied diploid-polyploid complexes of spined loaches *Cobitis*, phylogeography of Indo-Pacific Mugilidae, hybrid speciation in invasive sculpins *Cottus*, and speciation with gene flow in *Heliconius* butterflies. You can read more about these projects [here](/projects).

In my research, I mostly sit in front of the computer and I apply population genetic analyses on genomic data with the help of bioinformatics tools. Although I mostly study genomic data, when possible I also try to integrate information on the levels of genome, transcriptome, and phenotype.

Recently, my attention has also been drawn to [Big Data analytics](). With the current pace of data production, distributed computer systems are essential to collect, organize and analyze large sets. I have always been fascinated by how computers do the work for you and I try to learn more about how we can use the power of computing systems to understand large data-sets.

## Why Evodify.com?

The idea of having a personal website came to my mind in 2013, when I was working on my Masterâ€™s thesis at Harvard University. At that time, I started to appreciate websites which described comprehensive solutions of the same problems I faced. By the end of my thesis project, I also developed my solutions for some problems, and I wanted to share them. These solutions were not sufficient for a journal publication, but still could be very useful if published in blog posts. However, starting a blog is a serious step, and it took me two years to gain enough confidence and actually make this step.

In 2016, the website Evodify.com appeared online. Since my last name would not be easy to spell for some people, I named my website EVODIFY. Its origin is very simple: EVO stands for evolution, DI comes from my nickname Dima, FY is just to sound cool ðŸ™‚ .

Unfortunately, I am not able to work on this website as much as I originally wanted, but I regularly share my scripts with instruction on <a href="https://github.com/evodify" target="_blank">Github</a>.

## Hobby and free time

To relieve my mind from science, I like spending time with my family, doing sports, and <a href="https://1x.com/member/kryvokhyzhad" target="_blank">photographing nature</a>.


I also have a strong passion for open-source software and Linux OS. I make Linux video tutorials and publish them on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/AverageLinuxUser" target="_blank">my YouTube channel</a>. Check it out!
